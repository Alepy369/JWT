# JWT

This repo is based on the code from https://github.com/patrickgod/JwtWebApiTutorial.

When running make sure you have all the following nuggets installed:
  ``Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer``
  ``Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens``
  ``Swashbuckle.AspNetCore``
  ``Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Filters``
  ``System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt``

All the methods in the AuthController are running perfectly, execpt the first one wich is the GET method with the name GetUserName.
